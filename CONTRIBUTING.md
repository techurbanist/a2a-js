# Contributing to A2A JavaScript SDK

We love your input! We want to make contributing to the A2A JavaScript SDK as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

### Pull Requests

1. Fork the repository
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some amazing feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/amazing-feature`)
5. Open a Pull Request

### Pull Request Requirements

- Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface, if applicable.
- Update the examples/ directory with a minimal working example, if applicable.
- Ensure all tests pass by running `npm test`.
- The PR should work for Node.js 20.
- Keep code coverage high (>80% is the goal).

## Code Style

- We use ESLint and Prettier to ensure consistent code style
- Run `npm run lint` to check your code style
- Run `npm run format` to automatically format your code

## Testing

- Write tests for new code you create
- Run the test suite with `npm test`
