# Common Workflows Examples

This directory contains simple TypeScript examples demonstrating common A2A protocol workflows, as described in the documentation:

1. **Basic Task Execution (Synchronous / Polling)**
2. **Streaming Task Execution (SSE)**
3. **Multi-Turn Interaction (Input Required)**
4. **Push Notification Setup and Usage**
5. **File Exchange (Upload/Download)**
6. **Structured Data Exchange (Requesting/Providing JSON)**

Each example is a minimal client (and server stub if needed) that shows how to use the SDK for that workflow. See the source files for details.
